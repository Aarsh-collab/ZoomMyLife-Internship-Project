# Zoom My Life Problem Statement

**HealthInsightEngine** is a modular Python-based system that analyzes personal health data (hydration, sleep, steps, mood, and fatigue) from a CSV file and generates personalized insights using rule-based logic and basic statistical analysis. This project is designed to serve as the backend for a smart health assistant chatbot or a Streamlit dashboard.

---

---

## Features

-  Identifies trends in hydration, sleep, steps, mood, and fatigue.
-  Detects declining or improving health habits.
-  Correlates mood with sleep and hydration.
-  Weekly summaries and daily insights.
-  Modular functions for easy integration into a chatbot or Streamlit dashboard.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aarsh-collab/ZoomMyLife-Internship-Project.git

cd health-insight-engine
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn streamlit
```

## üìÑ CSV Format

Your health log CSV file should include the following columns (minimum recommended):

| Column Name               | Description                         |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `Date`                    | Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format         |
| `Hydration (glasses)`     | Number of glasses of water          |
| `Sleep (hours)`           | Total sleep hours                   |
| `Steps`                   | Number of steps walked              |
| `Mood`                    | Categorical mood (e.g., Happy, Sad) |
| `Fatigue Level (1-5)`     | Fatigue level, 1 = low, 5 = high    |

## üîç Generated Insights

Insights are generated by examining:

- **Trends**: e.g., increasing/decreasing hydration or sleep.
- **Thresholds**: e.g., below 8 glasses of water or 7 hours of sleep.
- **Variability**: e.g., inconsistent sleep patterns.
- **Correlations**: e.g., mood vs. sleep and hydration.
- **Warnings**: e.g., high fatigue levels, low activity.

## üß† Approach & Logic

This engine follows a **hybrid rule-based** and **statistical reasoning** approach:

- **Rule-Based Checks**:
  - Consecutive decreases/increases (e.g., in hydration or mood).
  - Threshold violations (e.g., less than 7 hours of sleep).
  - Consistency indicators (standard deviation).

- **Statistical Insights**:
  - Correlations between mood and hydration/sleep.
  - Averages and variability across a sliding window (last 3‚Äì4 days).

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Dates converted to datetime objects.
  - Forward-filling of missing values for continuity.
  - Mood mapping to numeric scores for quantitative analysis.

This modular design allows easy upgrades to ML-based modeling later.

## üìä Streamlit Dashboard

To launch the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run (zml.py file location in computer)
```

The `app.py` file loads the HealthInsightEngine and displays daily or weekly insights interactively.

## üöÄ Future Work

-  Natural-language generation.
- Use ML to predict next-day mood/fatigue.
- Calendar visualizations and recommendations.
- Web scraping for personalized health tips.
